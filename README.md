Quality content, internal linking, link building, site optimization, social media marketing, and Google Ads are examples of White Hat SEO.

#### Black Hat SEO
 
üçÑ In SEO, it refers to techniques that violate search engine guidelines. 

üçÑ To rank higher on search engine result pages (SERPs), these techniques exploit weaknesses in search engines.
 
- It mainly focuses on search engines and not on the human audience. People who are looking for a quick financial return on their website rather than a long term investment use black hat SEO techniques.

Sometimes, it may give quick results, but only for short duration, and over time it will have the opposite effect, e.g., it may downgrade your ranking and get you blacklisted by search engines. Examples of Black Hat SEO include keyword stuffing, duplicate content, cloaking, hiding content, thin content, doorway pages, link sachems, etc.
